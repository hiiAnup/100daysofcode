    <h2>Missile Man of India
    </h2>
    <div class="middle-contaner">
        <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian<br>
             aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and<br>
              raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the<br>
               next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and<br>
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was<br>
                 intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.<br>
                 [1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of<br>
                  ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,<br>
                   technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original<br>
                    nuclear test by India in 1974.
